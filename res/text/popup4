Congratulations, you've unlocked shrubs!
There is now enough soil for bigger, hardier plants such
as shrubs to grow! Shrubs are an intermediate species that
 covers the ground in shade and allows a larger variety of
 animals to move in, making it more difficult for lichen
and grass to grow. This changes the dominating types of
species that can grow in the environment.
