Welcome to Ecological succession!
Ecological succession is the process of how habitats
and/or ecological communities form or change over time.
It is how ecosystems can regrow and adapt from great
changes like forest fires, and it is how life can form
in barren areas, like the rock layer you see here. Add
some lichen to start forming a new ecological community!
