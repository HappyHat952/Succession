Congratulations, you've unlocked trees!
The soil is now rich and deep enough for trees to grow!
 Trees are an intermediate species that is also prevalent
 when ecological succession reaches its peak, where the 
environment is stable and all species in the community are 
knit together in a way that allows no new species to gain 
dominance in the area, called a climax community.
