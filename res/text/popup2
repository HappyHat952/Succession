LICHEN
Lichen is a pioneer species that has a big role
in primary ecological succession, which is when an
environment develops from an area with no life.
Lichen can grow on bare rocks and other places
with little to no soil or water, and as it grows
and dies it starts to form a thin layer of soil
on the surface of the area.
